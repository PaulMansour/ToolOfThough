# Second Post

This is the second post. Here is an interesting line of code
from the inimitable ngn over at the APL Orchard:

~~~
r[x⍳k],←v

This bears further study for three reasons. I am always befuddled by modified assignent. I am 
furhter befuddled when the fuction is not scalar. I am further befuddled by the indexing, and then even further by the fact there are repeated indices
and the function is catenate. Ok that's four reasons.
