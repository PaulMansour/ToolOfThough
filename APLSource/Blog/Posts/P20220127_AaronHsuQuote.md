# [Aaron Hsu at Function Conf 2022](/posts/aaronhsuquote)      

Aaron Hsu is giving a [talk at Functional conference 2022](https://confengine.com/conferences/functional-conf-2022/speaker/interview/aaron-w-hsu?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=FnConf-speaker-profiles)

In the interview Aaron says:

> More is accomplished by understanding the whole, than optimizing the part.

That is a first class aphorism.

It reminded me of the saying *premature optimization is the root of all evil*,
I think extracted from the full Donald Knuth quote:

> The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying
> about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times;
> premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming 

Aaron's formulation says more with less; it has a positive outlook.

Looking forward to seeing his presentation.
