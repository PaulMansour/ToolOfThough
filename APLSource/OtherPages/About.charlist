# About

This is the personal APL blog of Paul Mansour. 

The subtitle of this blog is taken from a series of math
books written by J.E. Thompson: Arithmetic for the Practical Man, Algebra for the Practical Man,
Geometry for the Practical Man etc. I believe that Richard Feynman tought himself math
from these books. This is, I think, the only thing we have in common.
