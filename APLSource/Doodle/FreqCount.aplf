 FreqCount

⍝ Hmm.. say I have a set of random numbers between 0 and 4 in a.
⍝ I want to count how many times each shows up.
⍝ Obviously something like {⍺ ⍵}⌸a sort of gets me there
⍝ but it would be convenient if the counts came in a vector
⍝ with counts for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in that order.
⍝ I can think of two other ways: +/(⍳5)∘.=a and b←5⍴0 ⋄ b[a]+←1.
⍝ What would real APLers write though?

⍝ ⎕io←0 ⋄ a←?100000⍴5
⍝ ]runtime -c "+/(⍳5)∘.=a" "{1-⍨≢⍵}⌸(⍳5),a" "1-⍨{≢⍵}⌸(⍳5),a" "1-⍨⊢∘≢⌸(⍳5),a"
